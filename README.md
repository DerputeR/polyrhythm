# Polyrhythm Playground!
Polyrhythms are one of the most difficult musical obstacles for any musician to encounter.
A polyrhythm is the layering of two contrasting rhythms on top of each other.
Examples of polyrhythms include: 
4:3 (4 evenly spaced notes are played in the same span of time as 3 evenly space notes, 16th notes against triplets), 5:3, 4:7, 7:11
Polyrhythms are difficult to play correctly as one’s hands, when playing an instrument such as the piano or a percussion instrument, must be synced up in different rhythms
This is like tracing a square with one hand while tracing a triangle with the other. 
When implemented and played correctly, polyrhythms have the potential to add depth, rhythmic tension, and contribute to the music’s overall tone. 
Polyrhythms are seen throughout many genres of music such as difficult classical piano pieces, jazz music, latin dance, and traditional African music.
A better understanding of how to play these polyrhythms and what they sound like will improvie musicality and technique in a wide variety of genres.
Furthermore, this not only contributes to the community of musicians but also for the community of composer’s. The ability to quickly hear how a polyrhythm would sound for a certain tempo, through an accessible, easy-to-use webpage, can facilitate unique and intricately layered musical composition.
