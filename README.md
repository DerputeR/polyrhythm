# Polyrhythm Playground!
Polyrhythms are one of the most difficult musical obstacles for any percussionist or pianist to encounter.
A polyrhythm is the layering of two contrasting rhythms on top of each other.
Examples of polyrhythms include: 
4:3 (4 evenly spaced notes are played in the same span of time as 3 evenly space notes, 16th notes against triplets)
5:3 
4:7
7:11
One’s hands when playing the piano or a percussion instrument must be synced up in different rhythms
Good example to relate to: Tracing a square with one hand while tracing a triangle with the other. 
When played correctly, they add depth, rhythmic tension, and can contribute to the music’s overall tone. 
Polyrhythms are seen throughout many genres of music such as difficult classical piano pieces, jazz music, latin dance, and traditional African music.
A better understanding of how to play these polyrhythms and what they sound like will not only improve technique but also musicality in a wide variety of genres
